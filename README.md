Data Analysis projects developed by Ricardo Siller

Here you'll find:

1.- Music Stream Project: in which I applied data processing and statistical methods for analyzing data from a music stream service in twin cities.

2.- Instacart Project: in which I analyzed commercial information for a food delivery app.

3.- Megaline Project: in which I analyzed fees from a cellphone company.

4.- Zuber Project: in which I analyze passenger preferences and discern the influence of external factors on rides. I scrutinize competitor data, and put hypotheses to the test, particularly exploring the correlation between weather conditions and ride frequency.

5.- ICE Store Project: in which I analyze various factors influencing the success of video games. By identifying patterns in these factors, I aim to predict which games are likely to perform well in the market. 

6.- Y.Afisha Project: This project is part of an externship opportunity in the analytical department of Y.Afisha. The primary objective of this project is to help optimize Y.Afisha's marketing expenses by analyzing customer behavior, sales, and marketing costs. My analysis focused on understanding how customers use the service, when they start making purchases, and how much revenue each customer generates. This was done by making extensive use of cohort analysis. Additionally, I evaluated the total marketing expenditure, determined the cost of customer acquisition for each marketing source, and assessed the return on marketing investment (ROMI).

7.- Doggy Delights: As an analyst, I'm collaborating with the marketing department of this large online store to find ways to increase revenue. My work involves prioritizing marketing hypotheses using ICE and RICE frameworks and analyzing A/B test results. By examining data on orders and visits, I aim to provide clear, data-driven insights to guide strategic decisions that will boost our online store's revenue.

8.- Byte and Brew: A robot-operated caf√© in Los Angeles. To ensure the success and sustainability of this ambitious project, as a data analyst, I study the types of establishments, chain versus independent restaurants, and successful characteristics. This analysis will guide strategic decisions and help us present Byte and Brew as a promising and innovative business opportunity.

9.- Taste Treasures: Here I'm collaborating with a startup focused on selling food products online. The objective is to analyze user behavior within their app to optimize the shopping experience and boost conversions. The analysis includes examining the sales funnel to identify where users drop off and conducting an A/A/B test to evaluate the impact of a new font design on user engagement. Using a dataset that logs user actions, the goal is to provide data-driven insights to enhance the app's quality and user experience, leading to informed decisions for future development.
