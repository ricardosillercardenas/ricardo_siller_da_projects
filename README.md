Here's what you'll find:

1. **Music Stream Project:** This project analyzes user behavior and music preferences in two cities, *Springfield* and *Shelbyville*, using data from an online music streaming service. The goal is to test the hypothesis that user activity varies by day of the week and differs between the cities. The project includes stages of data review, preprocessing, and hypothesis testing to identify significant trends and differences in music consumption patterns. The findings provide insights that can inform strategic decisions, such as targeted marketing and content curation, based on city-specific user behaviors.

2. **Instacart Project:** This project focuses on analyzing commercial data from *Instacart*, a grocery delivery platform. The goal is to explore and preprocess the dataset, which includes five key tables: orders, products, and order details. Each table provides insights into customer purchasing behavior, such as order frequency, product preferences, and timing of purchases. The dataset was adjusted to introduce missing values and duplicates for realistic data handling scenarios. By examining this data, the project aims to uncover patterns in customer behavior that can inform strategic decisions for improving customer experience and optimizing the shopping process on the Instacart platform.

3. **Megaline Project:** This project analyzes the revenue generated by Megaline's two prepaid plans, *Surf* and *Ultimate*, to determine which is more profitable. Using data from 500 customers, the analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and revenue comparison between the plans. The project also involves hypothesis testing to assess significant differences in average revenue between the plans and across regions, providing insights to optimize the company's advertising budget.

4. **Zuber Project:** In this project, I analyze passenger preferences and discern the influence of external factors on rides. I scrutinize competitor data and put hypotheses to the test, particularly exploring the correlation between weather conditions and ride frequency.

5. **ICE Store Project:** This project focuses on analyzing factors that influence the success of video games sold in the *ICE* online store. Utilizing data from 2016 on user and expert reviews, genres, platforms, and historical sales, the goal is to identify patterns that predict which games are likely to perform well in 2017. The analysis includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and modeling to gain insights into the gaming industry's dynamics. These findings will guide investment decisions and advertising strategies, helping to optimize the promotion and sales of video games on the ICE platform.

6. **Y.Afisha Project:** This project is part of an externship opportunity in the analytical department of *Y.Afisha*. The primary objective of this project is to help optimize Y.Afisha's marketing expenses by analyzing customer behavior, sales, and marketing costs. My analysis focused on understanding how customers use the service, when they start making purchases, and how much revenue each customer generates. This was done by making extensive use of cohort analysis. Additionally, I evaluated the total marketing expenditure, determined the cost of customer acquisition for each marketing source, and assessed the return on marketing investment (ROMI).

7. **Doggy Delights:** As an analyst, I'm collaborating with the marketing department of this large online store to find ways to increase revenue. My work involves prioritizing marketing hypotheses using *ICE* and *RICE* frameworks and analyzing A/B test results. By examining data on orders and visits, I aim to provide clear, data-driven insights to guide strategic decisions that will boost our online store's revenue.

8. **Byte and Brew:** A robot-operated caf√© in *Los Angeles*. To ensure the success and sustainability of this ambitious project, as a data analyst, I study the types of establishments, chain versus independent restaurants, and successful characteristics. This analysis will guide strategic decisions and help us present Byte and Brew as a promising and innovative business opportunity.

9. **Taste Treasures:** Here I'm collaborating with a startup focused on selling food products online. The objective is to analyze user behavior within their app to optimize the shopping experience and boost conversions. The analysis includes examining the sales funnel to identify where users drop off and conducting an A/A/B test to evaluate the impact of a new font design on user engagement. Using a dataset that logs user actions, the goal is to provide data-driven insights to enhance the app's quality and user experience, leading to informed decisions for future development.

10. **Sterling & Draper:** This project involves working as an analyst at the advertising agency *Sterling & Draper*, where our primary goal is to enhance the efficiency of our video trend analysis on YouTube. By developing a comprehensive dashboard, I aimed to automate the process of tracking and analyzing trending video categories, regions, and specific content that resonates particularly well in the United States. This dashboard not only streamlines our internal reporting processes but also provides valuable insights to our video planning managers, ensuring that our marketing strategies are data-driven and targeted for maximum impact.

11. **Model Fitness:** In this project, I worked on predicting customer churn for *Model Fitness*, a gym chain, utilizing data analysis and machine learning techniques. My role involved conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns in customer behavior, building predictive models such as logistic regression and random forest to estimate churn likelihood, and employing K-means clustering to segment customers. These insights were used to develop targeted retention strategies. By understanding the drivers behind customer attrition and identifying at-risk segments, I aimed to provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention and enhance the overall membership experience.
