Data Analysis projects developed by Ricardo Siller

Here you'll find:

1.- Music Stream Project: in which I applied data processing and statistical methods for analyzing data from a music stream service in twin cities.

2.- Instacart Project: in which I analyzed commercial information for a food delivery app.

3.- Megaline Project: in which I analyzed fees from a cellphone company.

4.- Zuber Project: in which I analyze passenger preferences and discern the influence of external factors on rides. I scrutinize competitor data, and put hypotheses to the test, particularly exploring the correlation between weather conditions and ride frequency.

5.- ICE Store Project: in which I analyze various factors influencing the success of video games. By identifying patterns in these factors, I aim to predict which games are likely to perform well in the market. 

6.- Y.Afisha Project: This project is part of an externship opportunity in the analytical department of Y.Afisha. The primary objective of this project is to help optimize Y.Afisha's marketing expenses by analyzing customer behavior, sales, and marketing costs. My analysis focused on understanding how customers use the service, when they start making purchases, and how much revenue each customer generates. This was done by making extensive use of cohort analysis. Additionally, I evaluated the total marketing expenditure, determined the cost of customer acquisition for each marketing source, and assessed the return on marketing investment (ROMI).

More projects coming soon.
